Project Description: 
The experience I wanted to convey was one of reflection on the various things we use to distract ourselves from the world. The piece is a gallery of items we use to draw or warp our perception toward the world around us. I wanted it to serve as a bridge between the traditional and contemporary form of Vanitas to show we haven't changed much as a species throughout history in that regard. I don't intend for the work to make anyone feel any which way other than where that sort of self-reflection might lead them.  I think it's important to try and remember where we are in the now, and by showcasing all these tools of distortion in sub-photorealistic quality beside the 2D image of the outside world, I feel it achieves a notable contrast begging the artificiality of the inside world we choose to be apart of. I chose a cave entrance for a door to the outside world to draw a parallel of this work with Plato's Cave and how the allegory is still applicable to us today. I chose blue and red lights because they're dramatic and placed the cooler lights next to the more contemporary side of the table opposite the warmer lighting of the more traditional side to portray the sense of how we feel we're becoming more soulless as society secularizes. It's no wonder nihilism is so much more pervasive in recent history when we use these things as substitutes for community and relationships and advances in science have left a hole in the heart of society where there was esotericism. Without religion people tend to struggle with where to put their faith in life, and often lose it altogether. If we're able to step back and recognize our everyday vices we might be able to regulate our consumption of substances and media to perhaps repair our ever deteriorating attention spans so that we can give more to those who matter in our lives. I hope this deep of a message is not immediate to grasp when looking at this work because that kind of nuance and attention to detail is something we could all strive toward, and I imagine would take more time than just a glance at my piece.
